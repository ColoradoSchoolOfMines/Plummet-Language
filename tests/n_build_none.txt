Example Test
echo "This is an example test, view the source to see how it works."

This file has a specific syntax, that being the following:
The first line must be the name of the test
The second line must be the command to run, this has to only be a single line
Anything past this is ignored, and can be used for comments (as seen here)
NOTE: TESTS MUST BE IN THE TESTS FOLDER!!
