Example Test
echo "This is an example test, view the source at tests/example_*.txt to see how it works."

File rules:
    Tests must be in the tests/test_files/ directory
    All tests must follow the naming convention of [number]_[in/out].txt
    The number must be unique, and the in/out must be either in or out

Syntax rules:
    The first line must be the name of the test
    The second line must be the command to run, this has to only be a single line
    Anything past these lines is ignored, and can be used for comments (as seen here)
